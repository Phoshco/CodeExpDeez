##Context and Problem Statement
Inconvenience of checking of training schedule and routine orders: Usually only posted on physical paper at the respective Company office

Orders given by commanders may not be clear: Commands given verbally may not be coherent, and easily forgotten

Differing commands from different commanders: Confusion 101

Engagement with people in other Companies within the Unit is low: Improved communication within Companies can help with better scheduling

Lack of stock at eMart and long queues during breaks: A better system to inform servicemen before physically going down is needed

#Proposed solution
An announcement App which the higher authorities can use to relay information to their subordinates, while also making purchase of items easier for all.

#Features
Military personnel with higher rank can make announcements to their subordinates

Senior commanders will be able to see commands given by junior commanders to troopers

Ease of checking eMart inventory and a pre-ordering pick up system

Virtual routine orders/training schedule and reminder
