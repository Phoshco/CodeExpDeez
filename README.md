### Context and Problem Statement
Inconvenience of checking of training schedule and routine orders: Usually only posted on physical paper at the respective Company office </br>

Orders given by commanders may not be clear: Commands given verbally may not be coherent, and easily forgotten </br>

Differing commands from different commanders: Confusion 101 </br>

Engagement with people in other Companies within the Unit is low: Improved communication within Companies can help with better scheduling </br>

Lack of stock at eMart and long queues during breaks: A better system to inform servicemen before physically going down is needed </br>


### Proposed solution
An announcement App which the higher authorities can use to relay information to their subordinates, while also making purchase of items easier for all. </br>


### Features
Military personnel with higher rank can make announcements to their subordinates </br>

Senior commanders will be able to see commands given by junior commanders to troopers </br>

Ease of checking eMart inventory and a pre-ordering pick up system </br>

Virtual routine orders/training schedule and reminder </br>
